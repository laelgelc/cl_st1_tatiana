# Corpus Linguistics - Study 1 - Phase 3 - Tatiana

Run the commands from the project phase directory, e.g.:

```text
cl_st1_ph3_tatiana/
```

## 1. CCA results extraction

Run the CCA results extraction programme on the SAS HTML output.

The Python script reads the Canonical Structure section of the SAS CANCORR results file and writes two JSON files:

- `cca_var.json`: Correlations between the VAR variables and their canonical variables.
- `cca_with.json`: Correlations between the WITH variables and their canonical variables.

Because no `--output-dir` argument is supplied here, both JSON files are written to the directory from which this shell script is executed.

```shell
python cca_results_extract.py \
    output_cl_st1_ph3_tatiana_CCA/tweets_cca-results.html
```
